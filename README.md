src folder contains the project ready to be processed by developers
dist folder is the final project version for deployment. It has uglified/minified js/css which are produced via grunt

this would be my preferred way to work on src, create dist and the just deploy dist to server. Any suggestion or imporovement is highly requested :)

all bower and grunt configuration are commited to be used at any time. eg. the bower.json provides all external components needed with command bower install.
